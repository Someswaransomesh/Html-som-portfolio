  Alaipayuthey is one of my favourite movie which is beautiful to watch,
  exploring the dynamics of a young couple post-marriage.
  There are multiple angles — its narrative style, class politics and 
  how each song was tonally different and so on — one can specifically pick and 
  write about on its 20th anniversary.

  One of my favourite actor Vijay Sethupathi sets his foot in Chennai with a dream of landing a job in London. 
  Accompanied by Yogi Babu, Vijay approaches a local travel agency in an attempt to get his passport and 
  other necessary documents required to fly out of the country. 
  Rest of the film deals with what people do in order to land themselves a job in foreign countries, 
  which is supposed to elevate their social status.
  It also narrates how people get conned with a generous dose of comedy.
